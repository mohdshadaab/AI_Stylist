## 1. Introduction

We are trying to build an end-to-end Computer Vision Pipeline for detecting characteristics for a fashion apparel. 

We will be using [DeepFashion2](https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2) dataset.

To complete this pipeline we will be using doing the following tasks:

* Image Segmentation([U2-Net](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net)) 
* Background Removal
* Object Detection([U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597))

## 2. Steps
TBD
